# Dungeon Runner
Goal of this project is to build a fairly complex web application/game using only basic HTML, CSS, Javascript. No frameworks or libraries other than the helper functions written by myself or if needed I will pull code from a library or functions written by others. Only the code necessary to solve the problem will be included. 

Dungeon Runner is my first serious attempt at a non-tutorial based project. Project will be using native ES6 modules. Each view will be rendered by its corresponding component. A component will consist of a componentname-component.HTML file which holds the template to be rendered by ["Templeting Engine"](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Javascript-template-engine-in-just-20-line) and a componentname-component.js file which will consist of a ES6 class object to control component logic and rendering of view. 

As of now all state will be managed by a state class which will interface with the browser localStorage. Once Project is near or at "Completion" Next step will be to build a nodeJS backend for serving page and handling state.

End Goal is to have a Single Page Application/Game and learn web development skills along the way. What I would like is to have this completed "Vanilla JS" game and to recreate in one or two of the top frameworks. I believe trying to follow this "Pure JS" path will help me understand better the abstraction and power of these frameworks as well as differentiate when using a framework, what is the framework and what is just javascript.
