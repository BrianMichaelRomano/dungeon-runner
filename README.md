# Dungeon Runner
Goal of this project is to build a fairly complex web application/game using only basic HTML, CSS, Javascript. No frameworks or libraries other than the helper functions written by myself or if needed I will pull code from a library or functions written by others. Only the code necessary to solve the problem will be included. 

Dungeon Runner is my first serious attempt at a non-tutorial based project. Project will be using native ES6 modules. Each view will be rendered by its corresponding component. A component will consist of a componentame-component.HTML file which holds the template to be rendered by ["Templeting Engine"](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Javascript-template-engine-in-just-20-line) and a componentname-component.js file which will consist of a ES6 class object to control component logic and rendering of view.
