    <h2>Welcome Adventurer</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the dungeon runner inn, where adventurers from far awway come to see what they are made of and how much gold will fill their pockets.....
        <i>*whispers* but to be honest most will only fill their pockets with blood...*clears throat*</i>
        You on the other hand look as though you may do just fine... <i>*sly smile*</i>
        Please sign in to our inn log book and head on up to your room. Get rested and in the morning we shall depart for the dungeons.
